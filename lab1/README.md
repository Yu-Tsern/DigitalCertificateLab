## Introduction to certificate authority
Certificate Authority is a trusted third party that issues electronic documents that verify a digital entity’s identification on the Internet. 
In cryptography mean, certificate authority verifies the ownership of the public key of the named subject of the certificate.


## Introduction to LAMP

LAMP is short for the software bundle of Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database management system and PHP programming language.
This bundle can realize the role and function of a web server, which can drive Web applications. Although not actually designed to work together, these open source software is comparatively simple and easy to use.
Besides this four software, this software bundle can also be combined with many other free and open-source software packages



## Network topology

![Alt text](pic/Picture1.png?raw=true "Title")


The node named CA will be the certificate authority in this experiment. The node named WS will be the web server in this experiment and we will install LAMP on this node to enable it to be a web server. Notice: we must wait for all the GENI node turn green, which means the remote machines are ready for us to use, then we can continue the following steps. This may take a while.

## Distribution of digital certificates

OpenSSL is a cryptographic toolkit for SSL and TLS. In this lab, it will be used to:

(1) generate private key and self-signed certificate for certificate authority,
(2) generate private key and certificate signing request for web server,
(3) sign the certificate signing request generated by the web server.

Fortunately, this toolkit is pre-installed on GENI, thus no installation is needed. After connecting to the CA node, take a look at the "/etc/ssl" directory. This is the directory that stores all files related to Openssl.

```
cd /etc/ssl
ls
```
You will see three files under this directory.

```
/etc/ssl
    certs
    openssl.cnf
    private
```

“certs” stores the digital certificate of this machine. “private” stores private keys. “openssl.cnf” specifies the configuration of OpenSSL.


###### Certificate Authority Configuration
Before this node can function as a certificate authority, some preparations need to be done. First, "index.txt", "newcerts", and "serial" should be created in this directory.

```
/etc/ssl
    certs
    index.txt
    newcerts
    openssl.cnf
    private
    serial
```

Since all these changes require root privilage, it is suggested to get into root environment before you start:

```
sudo su
touch index.txt
mkdir newcerts
echo 01 > serial
```
 
Second, edit "openssl.cnf" either remotely through "vim"/"vi" or transfer the file to your computer and edit it with your own editors. In line 42, replace the directory ".demoCA" with "/etc/ssl."

```
 [ CA_default ]
 
 dir             = /etc/ssl              # Where everything is kept
 certs           = $dir/certs            # Where the issued certs are kept
 crl_dir         = $dir/crl              # Where the issued crl are kept
 database        = $dir/index.txt        # database index file.
 #unique_subject = no                    # Set to 'no' to allow creation of
```

[ optional ] Change defaut values in line 129, 134, 139 and 146.

```
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName                     = Country Name (2 letter code)
countryName_default             = US
countryName_min                 = 2
countryName_max                 = 2

stateOrProvinceName             = State or Province Name (full name)
stateOrProvinceName_default     = MD

localityName                    = Locality Name (eg, city)

0.organizationName              = Organization Name (eg, company)
0.organizationName_default      = JHU

# we can do this but it is not needed normally :-)
#1.organizationName             = Second Organization Name (eg, company)
#1.organizationName_default     = World Wide Web Pty Ltd

organizationalUnitName          = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
organizationalUnitName_default  = ISI
```

If you choose to do download the file, here are some tips for file transfer. 

(1) SFTP

First, establish a SFTP connection by:

```
sftp -i <geni_private_key> -oPort=<geni_port> <user>@<host>
```

For example, 

```
sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa -oPort=28693 yjou2@pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu
```

After putting in the passphrase created when generating private key, a "sftp>" prompt should appear. Now, use "mget" command to fetch the file. If the file is retrieved succefully, it will show you the file name, file size, transfer rate and elapsed time.

```
sftp> mget /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
Fetching /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf to openssl.cnf
/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf                                            100%   11KB 213.1KB/s   00:00  
```

Once finishing editing files, use "put" command to upload thems.

```
sftp> put openssl.cnf
Uploading openssl.cnf to /users/yjou2/openssl.cnf
openssl.cnf                                                     100%   11KB 147.7KB/s   00:00   
```

(2) WinSCP

You can edit it directly through WinSCP, however, this requires you to change the permission of "openssl.cnf" first.

```
sudo chmod 777 openssl.cnf
```
 
Now, the CA node can generate its private key and self-signed certificate. The command of generating private key is:

```
openssl genrsa -out private/cakey.pem 2048
```

You can check whether the private key was generated succefully by listing files in "private." If everything went well, you will see a "cakey.pem" in it.

```
sudo ls private
```

Next, the command of creating self-signed certificate is:

```
openssl req -new -x509 -key private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem
```

It will ask you to type in information such as country name and organizaton name. If you did modify default values in previous steps, just leave it blank if values inside those brackets are the same as your expectation. Note that no server will be setup on CA node, so you can set whatever common name you want. However, when it comes to WS node, the common name should be consistent with your configuration.

```
root@ca:/etc/ssl# openssl req -new -x509 -key private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [US]:
State or Province Name (full name) [MD]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Baltimore
Organization Name (eg, company) [JHU]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [ISI]:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:jhuca.edu            
Email Address []:
```

###### Generate certificate signing request

Now, the CA node is ready to sign WS's certificate. The next step is to connect to the WS node and generate a certificate signing request(CSR). The following commands are used to generate private key and corresponding CSR.

```
cd /etc/ssl
sudo su
openssl genrsa -out jhuws.key 2048
openssl req -new -key jhuws.key -out jhuws.csr
```
 
Similar to the process of generating self-signed certificate on the CA node, it will ask you to put in several information. However, the common name cannot be set arbitrarily this time, it should be consistent with your configuration.

```
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:MD
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Baltimore
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:JHU
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:ISI
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:jhuws.edu
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
```

###### Transfer certificate signing request

Still, there are several ways to transfer files.

(1) SFTP

First, setup a connection with WS node and download the CSR.

```
sftp -i <geni_private_key> -oPort=<geni_port> <user>@<host>
mget <file_directory>
```

For example, 

```
$ sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa -oPort=28693 yjou2@pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/yu-tsern/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa': 
Connected to pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu.
sftp> mget /etc/ssl/jhuws.csr
Fetching /etc/ssl/jhuws.csr to jhuws.csr
/etc/ssl/jhuws.csr                                              100%  993    18.9KB/s   00:00    
sftp> 
```

Then, "ctrl + D" to exit the connection and setup another connection with the CA node. Note that we are not permitted to write to the "etc/ssl" on CA directly, thus it is put in "~" instead. It does not matter where we put the CSR file since the file location can be specified when signing CSRs.

```
$ sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa -oPort=28691 yjou2@pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/yu-tsern/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa': 
Connected to pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu.
sftp> put jhuws.csr
Uploading jhuws.csr to /users/yjou2/jhuws.csr
jhuws.csr                                                       100%  993    36.1KB/s   00:00  
```

(2) WinSCP

Still, using WinSCP requires changing permission of "openssl.cnf."

```
chmod 777 <file_name>
```

If you're using the same file name as we did in the previous steps, it is ”chmod 777 jhuws.csr”


###### Sign a CSR

After CSR is transfered to the CA node, we can sign it and generate a certificate.

```
sudo openssl ca -in <csr_location> -out <certificate_location> -days 3650
```

If you used sftp to transfer CSR, it is probably located at "~", thus, the command should look like:

```
sudo openssl ca -in ~/jhuws.csr -out ~/jhuws.crt -days 3650
```

It will ask you whether you would like to sign this request. Type "y" to those questions.

```
Using configuration from /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok

```

Once WS's certificate is generated, transfer "jhuws.crt" to WS node and "cacert.pem" to USER node. In general, a chain of certificates are needed when the server is proving its ownership of the public key. However, for simplicity, there's only one certificate in the chain in this lab. Additionally, recall that when client sees a chain of certificates, it trace the path of trust back to the root CA and see if it is trust worthy, and that is the reason why "cacert.pem" should be transfered to the USER node. 

If you transfer the certificate through your computer, either by SFTP or WinSCP, you can open it and take a look at its content. Use "cat" command to view it on Linux, or double click it on Mac/Windows. You can see that "jhuws.crt" is issued by "jhuca.edu," which is the certificate authority. 

To enable WS’s certificate, the certificate and private key should be put into "/etc/ssl."

```
sudo cp jhuws.crt /etc/ssl/certs
sudo cp jhuws.key /etc/ssl/private
```

## LAMP Installation

Since GENI VMs are linux-powered devices, only Apache, MySQL, and PHP need to be install. Note that the order of installation does matter because PHP server depends on the services of Apache and MySQL. After using SSH to connect to WS node, use  

```
sudo apt-get update
```

to update the latest package lists and their dependency.


###### Install MySQL:

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

During the installation, it will ask you to setup a password for MySQL administrator.

```
Package configuration


    ┌───────────────────────────┤ Configuring mysql-server-5.7 ├────────────────────────────┐
    │ While not mandatory, it is highly recommended that you set a password for the MySQL   │

    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ 


```

When the installation is completed, check whether it is installed successfully through the following command.

```
sudo netstat -tap | grep mysql
```

You should see a message similar to the following one, which means there is a listening port of mysql enabled.

```
tcp        0      0 localhost:mysql         *:*                     LISTEN      18658/mysqld  
```

 
###### Install Apache

```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

We can run a browser to check whether it is installed successfully after all other settings are completed.

###### Install PHP

```
sudo apt install php-pear php-fpm php-dev php-zip php-curl php-xmlrpc php-gd php-mysql php-mbstring php-xml libapache2-mod-php
```

It may take a while to install these packages. After it is installed, a “www” folder will be created under var. This folder will store source codes of the website.

```
/var
    backups
    cache
    emulab
    lib
    local
    lock
    log  
    mail  
    opt  
    run  
    spool  
    tmp  
    www
```

###### Install PHP and MySQL extensions

```
Command:” sudo apt-get install php-intl php-imagick php-imap php5-mcrypt php5-memcache php7.0-ps php-pspell php-recode php-snmp php7.0-sqlite php-tidy php7.0-xsl
```

Notice: the GENI node is initiated with an Ubuntu operation system following its default setting. If you choose other operation systems rather the default operation system, there might be a warning message showing on the screen and it may fail to initiate the GENI nodes.

###### Write a simple PHP website

We will write a simple PHP website and try to connect to it in order to test whether the PHP service was installed successfully. You can use whatever way you like to write the PHP source code. If you're trying to edit it directly, instructions of how to use WinSCP can be found in this link:

http://mountrouidoux.people.cofc.edu/CyberPaths/winscp.html
 
Recall that "www" stores the website source code. To make change to this file, first change its permission.

```
sudo chmod 777 /var/www
```

Second, create a file named “info.php” under the “www/html” folder, then copy these codes into this file:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

Third, restart the Apache service.

```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

To connect to it, some other configurations are needed. This part will be covered in the next section. 

###### Enable Apache SSL connection

In this lab, the connection test will be done by SSL connection, thus, it is required to enable SSL connection on Apache server. In the "/etc/apache2" directory, you can see “apache2.conf”, which specifies the apache configuration. Those "include" are used to add other configuration file. 

```
# Include module configuration:
IncludeOptional mods-enabled/*.load
IncludeOptional mods-enabled/*.conf

# Include list of ports to listen on
Include ports.conf
```

To enable SSL connection, copy "default-ssl.conf" from "sites-available" to "sites-enabled" directory.

```
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
```

Then, use 

```
ifconfig
```

to find IP address, and modify "default-ssl.conf" as follows:


```
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
        <VirtualHost 172.17.2.18:443>
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                ServerName www.jhuws.edu
                DocumentRoot /var/www/html

                # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
                # error, crit, alert, emerg.
                # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
                # modules, e.g.
                #LogLevel info ssl:warn

                ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

                # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
                # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
                # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
                # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
                # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
                #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf

                #   SSL Engine Switch:
                #   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
                SSLEngine on

                #   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing
                #   the ssl-cert package. See
                #   /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz for more info.
                #   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the
                #   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.
                SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/jhuws.crt
                SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/jhuws.key
```

In line 2, replace "default" with the IP address you just found. Do not remove “:443” after the IP addres. It is the port number for SSL connection. In line 4, insert a line and specify your ServerName. Note that this should be consistent with your previous setting while generating CSR. In line 32 and 33, change the directory to where your certificate and private key are stored. Save all these changes and use

```
sudo a2enmod ssl
```

to enable the SSL module of Apache2. Then, restart apache2 server using command:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## Connection test

Now we can test the result of all the previous work by connecting web server from the USER node. First, ssh the USER node.


###### Curl

Since browser on GENI run so slow that you will get crazy if you find you did something dumb, it is suggested to use Curl to test before you actually run a browser. To make your life easier, get into root environement to do the followings.

```
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get install curl
``` 

When the installation is completed, modify the hosts file. The hosts file translates names of websites to IP addresses before the machine made a DNS request. To modigy it, change the permission of this file

```
sudo chmod 777 hosts
```

and edit it so that the server name "jhuws.edu" is mapped to the IP addresses.

```
127.0.0.1       localhost loghost localhost.pkileo.ch-geni-net.geni.it.cornell.edu
10.10.2.1       ATK-link-1 ATK-0 ATK
10.10.1.1       CA-link-0 CA-0 CA
10.10.3.1       USER-link-2 USER-0 USER
10.10.3.2       WS-link-2 WS-2 WS
10.10.1.2       WS-link-0 WS-1
10.10.2.2       WS-link-1 WS-0
172.17.2.18     jhuws.edu
172.17.2.18     www.jhuws.edu
```

 
Where the “172.17.2.18” is the IP address of WS node. And jhuws.edu is the server name we set up before. After this changes are made, use

```
curl jhuws.edu
```

to see if it works well. If it returns a HTML response of our web server. The connection is successful. Next, include the SSL configuration 

```
curl https://jhuws.edu --cacert cacert.crt
```
 
If the HTML reponse still appears, congratulations! You can step further to test through the browser.

###### Browser

We choose Firefox browser in this experiment. Of course, you can choose other browsers if you like. This part should be done on both WS and USER node.

```
sudo apt-get install firefox
```

The following steps vary. They depend on your operating system. For windows and MacOS, they have to rely on third party softwares to display graphical interface.

###### Windows:

First, install Xming locally. Xming is an X11 display server for Microsoft Windows. Second, launch the X server. You should see the Xming icon in the taskbar if it is up and running. Third, use PuTTY to connect to the user node. You can read the instruction here if you are not familiar with PuTTY.

Remember to check these two options, "Enable X11 forwarding" and "MIT-Magic-Cookie-1," in PuTTy configuration.

Now, we are able to display browser in a graphical interface. Use this command to launch the browser:

```
firefox
```

It might take a while, just be patient and you can see your browser displayed with the help of Xming.


###### Mac

First, install XQuartz on your Mac. XQuartz is an X server designed for MacOS. Second, open Xquartz with terminal. You should see a xterm window displaying something similar to

```
bash-3.2$
```

Third, make an ssh connection to the user node in this terminal. Now, we are able to display browser in a graphical interface. Use this command to launch the browser:

```
firefox
```

###### Linux

It’s much simpler when you are using Linux rather than other operation systems. Just ssh into the Linux system of your choice using the -Y argument. Then, launch your Firefox.

```
firefox
```

###### Test Apache locally

Now, we are ready to test our server through browser. Open Firefox on the WS node using command 

```
firefox
```

Put “127.0.0.1” in the address bar and press ENTER. If it shows the "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page," the Apache service is installed successfully.


###### Test PHP locally

In this step, we will try to connect to the simple PHP website we wrote to test whether the PHP server functions correctly. First, run the browser on the WS node. Second, put "127.0.0.1/info.php" into the address bar. If we can see configuration information of PHP then we know the PHP service is installed successfully.


###### Connection test on USER node

Open the browser on user node and visit "jhuws.edu/info.php." If it shows you the same web page when testing PHP locally on the WS node. You can now try to install the digital certificate. Go to "preference >> Advanced >> Certificates >> View Certificates" in the browser menu.

![Alt text](pic/Picture52.png?raw=true "Title")

Then, import the "cacert.crt" we copy to user node before.

![Alt text](pic/Picture53.png?raw=true "Title")

Trust this certificate authority we build on our own.

![Alt text](pic/Picture54.png?raw=true "Title")

Now we can see our certificate authority is in the list of trusted certificate authorities.
 
![Alt text](pic/Picture55.png?raw=true "Title")

Visit "jhuws.edu/info.php" again, you can see there is a exclamation mark in the address bar, which means the connection is not secure.

![Alt text](pic/Picture56.png?raw=true "Title")

Try to use "https" instead of "http"

![Alt text](pic/Picture57.png?raw=true "Title")

You will see the exclamation mark was replaced by a green lock. The connection is now secure. We can view more details of this connection by click “>”.

![Alt text](pic/Picture58.png?raw=true "Title")

The information we put in when making the digital certificate is now shown in this window. So far, we have already finished the experiment of building a certificate authority and issuing a digital certificate.

## Revoke a digital certificate

Now, try to revoke the digital certificate. First, connect to the CA node and use this command to revoke the digital certificate. Recall that the name of the digital certificate we issued before is “jhuws.crt”

```
openssl ca -revoke jhuws.crt
```

You can see two messages, "Revoking Certificate _some number_" and "Data Base Updated." To make sure it is the one you expected, use 

```
cat index.txt
```

to see detail information of the certificate with that number. Now, create a new Certificate Revocation List(CRL) using this command:

```
openssl ca -gencrl -out thisca.crl
```

Recall that CRL is the filw that stores all the revoked certificate. You can take a look at the CRL by using

```
cat thisca.crl
```

Then, we initialize the ”crlnumber” to "00." Everytime a certificate is revoked, the number will increase by one. Finally, the digital certificate we issued before is successfully revoked.


## Connect to WS after the certificate was revoked

Remove the old "cacert.crt" and copy the new "cacert.pem" to the USER node. As we have done before, change the extension from "pem to "crt." Additionally, move the Certificate Revokation List, "thisca.crl," to the USER node. 

###### CURL

Then, try to connect to the WS node with curl. Note that the CRL is included this time. 

```
curl https://jhuws.edu --cacert cacert.crt --crlfile thisca.crl
```
 
You will see there's an error complaining the certificate was revoked. 

###### Browser

Unfortunately, Firefox removed the user interface of importing CRL, thus, we are not able to revoke a certificate on our own. Information can be found in the following website.

https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:ImprovingRevocation#Preload_Revocations_of_Intermediate_CA_Certificates

However, you can still try the a tool, MobaXterm, to configure CRL manually.

As you can see from the screenshot, you can move files on the leften side of the window, and there's a terminal on the righten side.

## Assignments

1. Google announces to mark the sites without HTTPS in chrome as non-secure by the end of January 2017, which means HTTPS is now mandatory for secure data in chrome. What’s the reason for Google to do so?

2. Find out one of the digital certificate stored on your laptop. Screenshot the digital certificate you found on your laptop.

3. X.509 is a popular SSL digital certificate standard, what content is included in the digital certificate in X.509 standard? Check the content in our digital certificate, screen shot it.
