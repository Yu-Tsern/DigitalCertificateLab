## Introduction to certificate authority
Certificate Authority is a trusted third party that issues electronic documents that verify a digital entity’s identification on the Internet. 
In cryptography mean, certificate authority verifies the ownership of the public key of the named subject of the certificate.


## Introduction to LAMP

LAMP is short for the software bundle of Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database management system and PHP programming language.
This bundle can realize the role and function of a web server, which can drive Web applications. Although not actually designed to work together, these open source software is comparatively simple and easy to use.
Besides this four software, this software bundle can also be combined with many other free and open-source software packages



## Network topology

![Alt text](pic/Picture1.png?raw=true "Title")


The node named CA will be the certificate authority in this experiment. The node named WS will be the web server in this experiment and we will install LAMP on this node to enable it to be a web server. Notice: we must wait for all the GENI node turn green, which means the remote machines are ready for us to use, then we can continue the following steps. This may take a while.

## Distribution of digital certificates

OpenSSL is a cryptographic toolkit for SSL and TLS. In this lab, it will be used to:

(1) generate private key and self-signed certificate for certificate authority,
(2) generate private key and certificate signing request for web server,
(3) sign the certificate signing request generated by the web server.

Fortunately, this toolkit is pre-installed on GENI, thus no installation is needed. After connecting to the CA node, take a look at the "/etc/ssl" directory. This is the directory that stores all files related to Openssl.

```
cd /etc/ssl
ls
```
You will see three files under this directory.

```
/etc/ssl
    certs
    openssl.cnf
    private
```

“certs” stores the digital certificate of this machine. “private” stores private keys. “openssl.cnf” specifies the configuration of OpenSSL.


###### Certificate Authority Configuration
Before this node can function as a certificate authority, some preparations need to be done. First, "index.txt", "newcerts", and "serial" should be created in this directory.

```
/etc/ssl
    certs
    index.txt
    newcerts
    openssl.cnf
    private
    serial
```

Since all these changes require root privilage, it is suggested to get into root environment before you start:

```
sudo su
touch index.txt
mkdir newcerts
echo 01 > serial
```
 
Second, edit "openssl.cnf" either remotely through "vim"/"vi" or transfer the file to your computer and edit it with your own editors. In line 42, replace the directory ".demoCA" with "/etc/ssl."

```
 [ CA_default ]
 
 dir             = /etc/ssl              # Where everything is kept
 certs           = $dir/certs            # Where the issued certs are kept
 crl_dir         = $dir/crl              # Where the issued crl are kept
 database        = $dir/index.txt        # database index file.
 #unique_subject = no                    # Set to 'no' to allow creation of
```

[ optional ] Change defaut values in line 129, 134, 139 and 146.

```
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName                     = Country Name (2 letter code)
countryName_default             = US
countryName_min                 = 2
countryName_max                 = 2

stateOrProvinceName             = State or Province Name (full name)
stateOrProvinceName_default     = MD

localityName                    = Locality Name (eg, city)

0.organizationName              = Organization Name (eg, company)
0.organizationName_default      = JHU

# we can do this but it is not needed normally :-)
#1.organizationName             = Second Organization Name (eg, company)
#1.organizationName_default     = World Wide Web Pty Ltd

organizationalUnitName          = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
organizationalUnitName_default  = ISI
```

If you choose to do download the file, here are some tips for file transfer. 

(1) SFTP

First, establish a SFTP connection by:

```
sftp -i <geni_private_key> -oPort=<geni_port> <user>@<host>
```

For example, 

```
sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa -oPort=28693 yjou2@pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu
```

After putting in the passphrase created when generating private key, a "sftp>" prompt should appear. Now, use "mget" command to fetch the file. If the file is retrieved succefully, it will show you the file name, file size, transfer rate and elapsed time.

```
sftp> mget /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
Fetching /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf to openssl.cnf
/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf                                            100%   11KB 213.1KB/s   00:00  
```

Once finishing editing files, use "put" command to upload thems.

```
sftp> put openssl.cnf
Uploading openssl.cnf to /users/yjou2/openssl.cnf
openssl.cnf                                                     100%   11KB 147.7KB/s   00:00   
```

(2) WinSCP

You can edit it directly through WinSCP, however, this requires you to change the permission of "openssl.cnf" first.

```
sudo chmod 777 openssl.cnf
```
 
Now, the CA node can generate its private key and self-signed certificate. The command of generating private key is:

```
openssl genrsa -out private/cakey.pem 2048
```

You can check whether the private key was generated succefully by listing files in "private." If everything went well, you will see a "cakey.pem" in it.

```
sudo ls private
```

Next, the command of creating self-signed certificate is:

```
openssl req -new -x509 -key private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem
```

It will ask you to type in information such as country name and organizaton name. If you did modify default values in previous steps, just leave it blank if values inside those brackets are the same as your expectation. Note that no server will be setup on CA node, so you can set whatever common name you want. However, when it comes to WS node, the common name should be consistent with your configuration.

```
root@ca:/etc/ssl# openssl req -new -x509 -key private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [US]:
State or Province Name (full name) [MD]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Baltimore
Organization Name (eg, company) [JHU]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [ISI]:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:jhuca.edu            
Email Address []:
```

###### Generate certificate signing request

Now, the CA node is ready to sign WS's certificate. The next step is to connect to the WS node and generate a certificate signing request(CSR). The following commands are used to generate private key and corresponding CSR.

```
cd /etc/ssl
sudo su
openssl genrsa -out jhuws.key 2048
openssl req -new -key jhuws.key -out jhuws.csr
```
 
Similar to the process of generating self-signed certificate on the CA node, it will ask you to put in several information. However, the common name cannot be set arbitrarily this time, it should be consistent with your configuration.

```
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:MD
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Baltimore
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:JHU
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:ISI
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:jhuws.edu
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
```

###### Transfer certificate signing request

Still, there are several ways to transfer files.

(1) SFTP

First, setup a connection with WS node and download the CSR.

```
sftp -i <geni_private_key> -oPort=<geni_port> <user>@<host>
mget <file_directory>
```

For example, 

```
$ sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa -oPort=28693 yjou2@pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/yu-tsern/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa': 
Connected to pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu.
sftp> mget /etc/ssl/jhuws.csr
Fetching /etc/ssl/jhuws.csr to jhuws.csr
/etc/ssl/jhuws.csr                                              100%  993    18.9KB/s   00:00    
sftp> 
```

Then, "ctrl + D" to exit the connection and setup another connection with the CA node. Note that we are not permitted to write to the "etc/ssl" on CA directly, thus it is put in "~" instead. It does not matter where we put the CSR file since the file location can be specified when signing CSRs.

```
$ sftp -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa -oPort=28691 yjou2@pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/yu-tsern/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa': 
Connected to pc2.geni.it.cornell.edu.
sftp> put jhuws.csr
Uploading jhuws.csr to /users/yjou2/jhuws.csr
jhuws.csr                                                       100%  993    36.1KB/s   00:00  
```

(2) WinSCP

Still, using WinSCP requires changing permission of "openssl.cnf."

```
chmod 777 <file_name>
```

If you're using the same file name as we did in the previous steps, it is ”chmod 777 jhuws.csr”


###### Sign a CSR

After CSR is transfered to the CA node, we can sign it and generate a certificate.

```
sudo openssl ca -in <csr_location> -out <certificate_location> -days 3650
```

If you used sftp to transfer CSR, it is probably located at "~", thus, the command should look like:

```
sudo openssl ca -in ~/jhuws.csr -out ~/jhuws.crt -days 3650
```

It will ask you whether you would like to sign this request. Type "y" to those questions.

```
Using configuration from /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok

```

Once WS's certificate is generated, transfer "jhuws.crt" to WS node and "cacert.pem" to USER node. In general, a chain of certificates are needed when the server is proving its ownership of the public key. However, for simplicity, there's only one certificate in the chain in this lab. Additionally, recall that when client sees a chain of certificates, it trace the path of trust back to the root CA and see if it is trust worthy, and that is the reason why "cacert.pem" should be transfered to the USER node. 

If you transfer the certificate through your computer, either by SFTP or WinSCP, you can open it and take a look at its content. Use "cat" command to view it on Linux, or double click it on Mac/Windows. You can see that "jhuws.crt" is issued by "jhuca.edu," which is the certificate authority. 

To enable WS’s certificate, the certificate and private key should be put into "/etc/ssl."

```
sudo cp jhuws.crt /etc/ssl/certs
sudo cp jhuws.key /etc/ssl/private
```

## LAMP Installation

Since GENI VMs are linux-powered devices, only Apache, MySQL, and PHP need to be install. Note that the order of installation does matter because PHP server depends on the services of Apache and MySQL. After using SSH to connect to WS node, use  

```
sudo apt-get update
```

to update the latest package lists and their dependency.


###### Install MySQL:

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

During the installation, it will ask you to setup a password for MySQL administrator.

```
Package configuration











    ┌───────────────────────────┤ Configuring mysql-server-5.7 ├────────────────────────────┐
    │ While not mandatory, it is highly recommended that you set a password for the MySQL   │

```

When the installation is completed, check whether it is installed successfully through the following command.

```
sudo netstat -tap | grep mysql
```

You should see a message similar to the following one, which means there is a listening port of mysql enabled.

```
tcp        0      0 localhost:mysql         *:*                     LISTEN      18658/mysqld  
```

 
###### Install Apache

```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

We can run a browser to check whether it is installed successfully after all other settings are completed.

###### Install PHP

```
sudo apt install php-pear php-fpm php-dev php-zip php-curl php-xmlrpc php-gd php-mysql php-mbstring php-xml libapache2-mod-php
```

It may take a while to install these packages. After it is installed, a “www” folder will be created under var. This folder will store source codes of the website.

```
/var
    backups
    cache
    emulab
    lib
    local
    lock
    log  
    mail  
    opt  
    run  
    spool  
    tmp  
    www
```

###### Install PHP and MySQL extensions

```
Command:” sudo apt-get install php-intl php-imagick php-imap php5-mcrypt php5-memcache php7.0-ps php-pspell php-recode php-snmp php7.0-sqlite php-tidy php7.0-xsl
```

Notice: the GENI node is initiated with an Ubuntu operation system following its default setting. If you choose other operation systems rather the default operation system, there might be a warning message showing on the screen and it may fail to initiate the GENI nodes.

###### Enable Apache SSL connection

In this lab, the connection test will be done by SSL connection, thus, it is required to enable SSL connection on Apache server. In the "/etc/apache2" directory, you can see “apache2.conf”, which specifies the apache configuration. Those "include" are used to add other configuration file. 

```
# Include module configuration:
IncludeOptional mods-enabled/*.load
IncludeOptional mods-enabled/*.conf

# Include list of ports to listen on
Include ports.conf
```

To enable SSL connection, copy "default-ssl.conf" from "sites-available" to "sites-enabled" directory.

```
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
```

Then, use 

```
ifconfig
```

to find IP address, and modify "default-ssl.conf" as follows:


```
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
        <VirtualHost 172.17.2.18:443>
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                ServerName www.jhuws.edu
                DocumentRoot /var/www/html

                # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
                # error, crit, alert, emerg.
                # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
                # modules, e.g.
                #LogLevel info ssl:warn

                ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

                # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
                # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
                # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
                # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
                # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
                #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf

                #   SSL Engine Switch:
                #   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
                SSLEngine on

                #   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing
                #   the ssl-cert package. See
                #   /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz for more info.
                #   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the
                #   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.
                SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/jhuws.crt
                SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/jhuws.key
```

In line 2, replace "_default_" by your IP address. “443” is the port number for SSL connection. In line 4, insert your ServerName. Note that this should be consistent with your previous setting while generating CSR. In line 32 and 33, change the directory of where your certificate and private key are stored. Save all these changes and use

```
sudo a2enmod ssl
```

to enable the SSL module of Apache2. Then, restart apache2 server using command:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## Connection test

Now we can test the result of all the previous work by connecting web server from the USER node. First, ssh the USER node.


###### Curl

Since browser on GENI run so slow that you will get crazy if you find you did something dumb, it is suggested that use Curl to test before you run a browser. To make your life easier, get into root environement to do the followings.

```
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get install curl
``` 

When the installation is completed, modify the hosts file. The hosts file translates names of websites to IP addresses locally, that is, before the machine made a DNS request. Change permission of this file

```
sudo chmod 777 hosts
```

and edit it so that the server name "jhuws.edu" maps to the IP addresses.

```
127.0.0.1       localhost loghost localhost.pkileo.ch-geni-net.geni.it.cornell.edu
10.10.2.1       ATK-link-1 ATK-0 ATK
10.10.1.1       CA-link-0 CA-0 CA
10.10.3.1       USER-link-2 USER-0 USER
10.10.3.2       WS-link-2 WS-2 WS
10.10.1.2       WS-link-0 WS-1
10.10.2.2       WS-link-1 WS-0
172.17.2.18     jhuws.edu
172.17.2.18     www.jhuws.edu
```

 
Where the “172.17.2.18” is the IP address of WS node. And jhuws.edu is the server name we set up before. After this changes are made, use

```
curl jhuws.edu
```

to see if it works well. If it returns a HTML response of our web server. The connection is successful. Next, include the SSL configuration 

```
curl https://jhuws.edu --cacert cacert.crt
```
 
If the HTML reponse still appears, congratulations! You can step further to test through the browser.

###### Browser

We choose Firefox browser in this experiment. Of course, you can choose other browsers if you like. This part should be done on user node.

```
sudo apt-get install firefox
```

The operation of next step will be different for windows, Mac and Linux operation systems. For windows and MacOS operation systems, we need to depend on third party software to enable the graphics display on GENI node.

###### For Windows operation system:
Install the Xming software on your local operation system. Xming is an X11 display server for Microsoft Windows operating systems. Then run it to start the X server. You should see the Xming icon in the taskbar if it is running.

![Alt text](pic/Picture12.png?raw=true "Title")


Then use PuTTY to log onto the GENI node. 
You can see the instruction here about how to log onto GENI node using PuTTY.
http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/HowTo/LoginToNodes
Remember to click the option on X11 option besides the other steps of logging onto GENI node using PuTTY.


![Alt text](pic/Picture13.png?raw=true "Title")


Then we can run the graphics display on GENI node on Windows operation system.

```
firefox
```
![Alt text](pic/Picture14.png?raw=true "Title")


Wait for a second, and then we can see the browser GUI display is shown with the help of Xming

###### For MacOS operation system

Install XQuartz on your Mac. XQuartz is an X server designed for MacOS.
 
![Alt text](pic/Picture16.png?raw=true "Title")

 
Right click on the XQuartz icon in the dock and select Applications > Terminal. This should bring up a new xterm terminal windows.

![Alt text](pic/Picture17.png?raw=true "Title")

Then make an ssh connection to the GENI node on this terminal windows.

![Alt text](pic/Picture18.png?raw=true "Title")

 
We can enable the graphics display of browser on GENI node with the help of XQuartz software.

```
firefox
```

###### For other Linux operation system
It’s much simple when you are using Linux operation system.
Just ssh into the Linux system of your choice using the -Y argument.

![Alt text](pic/Picture20.png?raw=true "Title")


Then run Firefox browser.
```
firefox
```
 
![Alt text](pic/Picture21.png?raw=true "Title")

## Test Apache service and PHP service

Now because we already installed and enable the browser. We can test the Apache service and PHP service installed before.
###### Test Apache service

Open the Firefox browser using command 

```
firefox
```

Enter “127.0.0.1” on the browser. If it shows the following image then it means the Apache service is installed successfully.

![Alt text](pic/Picture22.png?raw=true "Title")

###### Test PHP service

We can write a simple PHP website and then run it to test whether the PHP service is installed successfully or not.
For the convenience, we can use the WinSCP software to write PHP source code. The instruction of how to log onto GENI node using WinSCP can be found in this link:
http://mountrouidoux.people.cofc.edu/CyberPaths/winscp.html
 
![Alt text](pic/Picture23.png?raw=true "Title")


We need to give the privilege to edit the "www" folder under the /var. As I mentioned before, "www" folder contains the website source code.
```
sudo chmod 777 /var/www
```

![Alt text](pic/Picture24.png?raw=true "Title")



Under the “www/html”folder, create a file named “info.php” and then write the following code into it:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```
![Alt text](pic/Picture25.png?raw=true "Title")


And then we need to restart the Apache service.
```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```
![Alt text](pic/Picture26.png?raw=true "Title")
 

Run the browser and this time enters "127.0.0.1/info.php" into the browser. If we can see the relative configuration information of PHP then it means that PHP service is installed successfully.

![Alt text](pic/Picture27.png?raw=true "Title")



Open the browser on user node. You can refer the instruction before about how to run and open a browser on GENI node.
We visit the jhuws.edu/info.php first.
 
![Alt text](pic/Picture50.png?raw=true "Title") 


It works right, and then we install the digital certificate. We go to the preference option of the browser.

![Alt text](pic/Picture51.png?raw=true "Title")

 
Then go to the Advanced, Certificates options. Click on “View Certificates”

![Alt text](pic/Picture52.png?raw=true "Title")


Then import the cacert.crt file we put on user node before.

![Alt text](pic/Picture53.png?raw=true "Title")


Trust this certificate authority we build by our own.

![Alt text](pic/Picture54.png?raw=true "Title")


Now we can see our certificate authority is in the list of certificate authorities.
 
![Alt text](pic/Picture55.png?raw=true "Title")


We visit jhuws.edu/info.php firstly, we can see the connection is unsecure.

![Alt text](pic/Picture56.png?raw=true "Title")

 
Then we visit https://jhuws.edu/info.php

![Alt text](pic/Picture57.png?raw=true "Title")


And this time we can see there appears a green lock and remind us now it’s a secure connection.
We can view the details of this connection by click the “>”.

![Alt text](pic/Picture58.png?raw=true "Title")


The information we put in when making the digital certificate is shown in this display.
By now, we have already finished the experiment of building a certificate authority and issue a digital certificate.

## Revoke a digital certificate
Then we can try to revoke the digital certificate to see how it works and what is the result it will turn out.
To revoke the digital certificate we issue before, we should log onto the ca node, which is the certificate authority.
Use this command to revoke the digital certificate we issued before. The name of digital certificate we issued before is “jhuws.crt”
```
openssl ca -revoke jhuws.crt
```

![Alt text](pic/Picture59.png?raw=true "Title")

We can use this command”cat index.txt” to check the index of our digital certificate. It’s 03, so everything is going right.

![Alt text](pic/Picture60.png?raw=true "Title")


And we should renew the crl, which is short for Certificate Revocation List. The digital certificate we revoked will be given the index and record in this list.
Use this command:
```
openssl ca -gencrl -out thisca.crl
```
to generate the index of the digital certificate we just revoke.
We can have a look at the thisca.crl file.

![Alt text](pic/Picture61.png?raw=true "Title")

 
It stores the Certificate Revocation List.
Then we need add content ”00” into ”crlnumber”, to let the crl start to record.
Each time we revoke a digital certificate, it will add one to itself.

![Alt text](pic/Picture62.png?raw=true "Title")

 
I have revoked twice the digital certificate, so the number shown is 02.
Then we have successfully revoked a digital certificate we issued before.


## Connect after certificate is revoked

To see the result after we revoke an issued digital certificate. Because we are actually not using network to verify. Therefore we need to import the new cacert.crt onto the user node.
Remove the old cacert.crt and import the new cacert.crt. As the same we have done before, we actually move the file “cacert.pem”, but we need to change the extension”.pem” to “.crt”.
 
 ![Alt text](pic/Picture63.png?raw=true "Title")
 
 ![Alt text](pic/Picture64.png?raw=true "Title")
 
 
Also we should move the thisca.crl which stores the Certificate Revocation List to the user node.

 ![Alt text](pic/Picture65.png?raw=true "Title")
 
Because our certificate authority is offline, therefore we need to move these files manually.
Then we can see the result after we revoke a digital certificate. We still use curl tool to find out.
We use this command:
```
curl https://jhuws.edu --cacert cacert.crt --crlfile thisca.crl
```
to visit our site we build before. We need the options”—cacert” and “—crlfile” to include the ca document and crl document manually.

 ![Alt text](pic/Picture66.png?raw=true "Title")

 
Now we can see the digital certificate has already been revoked.
As for the Firefox browser we installed before, we also need to update the ca document and crl document. But Firefox browser has already remove the user interface on Firefox to import the crl document, so we can’t see the result on Firefox since we are the offline certificate authority and need us to import the ca document and crl document manually.

Revise
You also can try the tool named MobaXterm to log in GENI node and move the file.

 ![Alt text](pic/Picture68.png?raw=true "Title")

As you can see from the above graph, on the left part of this tool you can move the file and the right part of this tool is the terminal. It would be more convenient for your experiment.
